# BillBank
A Bank. A RPC Bank. A Functional RPC Bank.

Actually, you need to download vcpkg at first.

Then, after building and change settings, create files like this:

->

  C:\home\grpc-bank\bank_client
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\bank_server
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\common
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\proto
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\grpc-bank.sln
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\x64
  
  c:\home\vcpkg
  
  c:\home\packages_include

At last, duplicate C:\home\grpc-bank\Bill_music.wav to C:\home\grpc-bank\x64\Debug
