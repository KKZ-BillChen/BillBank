A Bank. A RPC Bank. A Functional RPC Bank.

Actually, you need to download vcpkg at first.

Then, after building and change settings, create files like this:

```
  C:\home\grpc-bank\bank_client
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\bank_server
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\common
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\proto
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\grpc-bank.sln
  
  C:\home\grpc-bank\x64
  
  c:\home\vcpkg
  
  c:\home\packages_include

```
# U should use Visual Studio 2019, not 2022! 2019, Yes!

  Or Just FRP to test.
